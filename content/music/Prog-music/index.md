It’s been a year since a friend sent me a piece built around the Fibonacci sequence. I figured, why not — and I was immediately hooked. That single recommendation opened a door. I started digging through *Tool’s* discography and soon found myself in the deeper, darker world of prog-metal. One album led to another until I stumbled on **Blackwater Park** — the record that really changed everything for me.

**Blackwater Park** felt like being pulled into a raw, brooding atmosphere I didn’t know music could create. The textures, the dynamic shifts, the way quiet and fury trade places — it was an alarm bell for my ears. For a while I chased that feeling, listening for the exact moment that had hit me. Nothing else matched it at first, so I wondered if it had been a one-time thing.

Then I realized I’d barely scratched Opeth’s catalogue. **Still Life** woke me up. The filthy growls and sudden clean singing worked together in a way that made Opeth feel unique — their contrasts gave the songs narrative weight, like chapters in a novel.

From there I went back to 1970s prog-rock. **Close to the Edge** drove me, literally, close to the edge: that organ work and the long, evolving sections felt transcendent. King Crimson’s **“Epitaph”** and **“Starless”** — half a century old — captured a sense of collective unease that still rings true.

These discoveries convinced me of something: prog music combines mathematical structure, dramatic storytelling, and raw human emotion in ways few other forms do. It can be cerebral and visceral at the same time. For me, that blend — the intellect of complexity and the gut-punch of feeling — is why prog is the ultimate form of human expression.

What I’m still chasing now isn’t just a particular sound, but that rare moment when composition, performance, and feeling align so perfectly you forget you’re listening.
