**Album Overview**    

  - Artist: Blood Incantation
  - Album: Absolute Elsewhere
  - Release Year: 2024
  - Genre: Ambient, Space Music



Blood Incantation is best known for their complex and atmospheric take on death metal, blending crushing riffs with spacey interludes. But with Absolute Elsewhere, they leave behind the brutality and fully embrace an ambient, synth-driven sound. It’s a drastic shift, but one that makes sense given their long-standing interest in cosmic themes.

**Sound & Atmosphere**

This album is pure space music, with long, flowing synth compositions that feel vast and meditative. There are no guitars, drums, or growls—just layers of electronic soundscapes that drift between calm and eerie. It feels heavily influenced by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Brian Eno, bringing to mind classic 70s ambient and Berlin School electronica.

Unlike their previous work, which balanced aggression with atmosphere, Absolute Elsewhere commits fully to its ambient concept. The production is lush and immersive, with deep, resonant synth tones that create a sense of floating through space.
