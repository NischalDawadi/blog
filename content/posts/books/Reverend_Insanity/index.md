*Reverend Insanity* by Gu Zhen Ren is not your typical cultivation webnovel. It is a dark, complex and unapologetically philosophical story about a man who refuses to die — not just in body, but in will. Through the eyes of Fang Yuan, the novel explores the price of ambition, the nature of power, and the question: *what does it truly mean to live freely?*


### The Gu World: Power Engineered Through Strategy, Not Justice

In the Gu world, everything is a transaction — nothing is free, and no one is safe. Magical creatures called **Gu** grant power, but only to those clever or ruthless enough to use them. Unlike other fantasy systems, cultivation here is not about destiny or righteousness. It is about planning, deception, and overwhelming force.

The world rewards not the kind-hearted, but the calculating. As one quote from the novel sums it:
>[!QUOTE]
> *“In this world there are only eternal benefits, there are no eternal friends or enemies.”*

This sets the tone for everything that follows. It is a system that strips away idealism and lays bare the laws of survival.

### Fang Yuan: A Man Who Refuses to Bow — Even to Heaven

Fang Yuan’s goal is not revenge, not justice, not even wealth. It is **eternal life**. Reborn with the memories of a past life, he walks a path that no one else dares — one paved with blood, betrayal, and unshakable resolve.

But Fang Yuan’s ruthlessness is not emotional. It is cold and logical. Every action he takes, no matter how cruel, serves a long-term vision: freedom from death, freedom from fate. As he states:

>[!QUOTE]
> *“There is only immortality. Only eternal life should be the goal one should pursue.”*

What makes him fascinating is not his power, but his discipline. He is not a madman. He is clarity, stripped of comfort.

### The Philosophy of Ren Zhu: Nature’s True Law

Threaded through the novel is the chilling yet thought-provoking philosophy of **Ren Zhu**, which teaches that mercy is weakness, and that nature favors those willing to discard emotion for advancement.

Fang Yuan embodies this truth. He does not seek to change the world — he adapts to it with brutal precision. He uses morality only when it’s useful, discards it when it isn’t.

This challenges readers: if nature is truly indifferent, why should we cling to ideals? Are morals principles… or conveniences?

### Side Characters That Echo Through the Story

Though Fang Yuan is the center, several side characters leave deep impressions and elevate the narrative:

- **Spectral Soul Demon Venerable** — an ancient power whose philosophy and might shadow Fang Yuan’s path, highlighting the cost of great power.  
- **Red Lotus Demon Venerable** — a fierce embodiment of ambition and sacrifice, mirroring Fang Yuan’s own drive.  
- Others, like Bai Ning Bing and Hei Lou Lan, challenge or assist Fang Yuan, but ultimately reinforce the novel’s truth: survival is temporary — only legacy endures.

Each of these characters, though sometimes short-lived, alters the course of the narrative and the mind of the reader.

### Defying Heaven’s Will: The Battle Against Fate Itself

The most powerful force in the novel isn’t a person — it is **Heaven’s Will**, the divine force that shapes destiny, favors certain outcomes, and preserves cosmic order.

Fang Yuan’s war is not only against his enemies — it is against this **pre-written fate**. His rebellion is philosophical. It is the cry of a man who says, *“I will not be a pawn. Not in any game. Not even Heaven’s.”*

In a world like ours, filled with rules and systems that often feel out of our control, Fang Yuan’s defiance feels deeply relatable. He may be extreme — but the fire of his resistance is something most readers recognize in themselves.

### Final Thoughts: A Brutal, Brilliant Exploration of Human Will

*Reverend Insanity* is a rare kind of story: one that doesn’t try to comfort you. It doesn’t offer a clean moral path or a satisfying idea of heroism. Instead, it forces you to ask: *What would I sacrifice for my goal?* *Can I face the world as it truly is, not as I wish it to be?*

It’s not for everyone. But for those willing to walk its path, it delivers one of the most thought-provoking journeys in fantasy fiction.
