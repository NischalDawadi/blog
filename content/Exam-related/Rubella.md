## How nepal eliminated rubella 

|Intervention|Details|
|---|---|
|**Vaccine introduction**|Rubella vaccine (combined or part of MR) introduced in 2012; second dose added in routine immunization in 2016. ([World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/nepal/news/detail/18-08-2025-nepal-eliminates-rubella?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Nepal eliminates rubella"))|
|**Periodic immunization campaigns**|Campaigns in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024 helped raise coverage.

|**High vaccine coverage**|By 2024, over 95% of children got at least one dose of rubella vaccine.

|**Surveillance & lab system**|Strengthened disease surveillance (case-based), congenital rubella syndrome monitoring, lab algorithms. ([World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/nepal/news/detail/18-08-2025-nepal-eliminates-rubella?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Nepal eliminates rubella"))|

### 1. **Definition 

- **Rubella elimination** = Interruption of endemic rubella virus transmission in a defined geographic area for ≥12 months, with a high-quality surveillance system in place.

- It is not eradication (disease can still be imported).

---

### 2. **Background **

- Rubella causes mild illness but is dangerous in pregnancy → congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

- Globally, WHO SEAR (South-East Asia Region) aimed for rubella elimination by 2023.

- Nepal achieved verification of **rubella elimination in August 2025** (WHO announcement).


---

### 3. **Key Interventions **

Nepal used a **multi-pronged epidemiological strategy**:

**a. Vaccine introduction & expansion**

- Rubella-containing vaccine introduced in **2012** as part of national immunization schedule.

- **Second dose** added in **2016** for stronger immunity.


**b. Mass immunization campaigns**

- Nationwide rubella / measles–rubella (MR) campaigns in **2012, 2016, 2020, 2024**.

- Campaigns targeted children 9 months–15 years, closing immunity gaps.


**c. High coverage achieved**

- Routine immunization coverage consistently **>95%** by 2024.

- Two-dose MR coverage expanded across all provinces.


**d. Strong surveillance system**

- Case-based measles-rubella surveillance integrated with EWARS.

- Laboratory confirmation of suspected cases via national reference labs.

- **Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) surveillance** established.


**e. Outbreak investigation & rapid response**

- Any suspected outbreaks (clusters of fever & rash) investigated quickly with lab support.

- Outbreak response immunization where needed.


**f. Verification process**

- National Verification Committee (NVC) compiled evidence: vaccination data, epidemiological trends, surveillance quality indicators.

- WHO Regional Verification Commission confirmed elimination status (Aug 2025).


---

### 4. **Results / Outcome **

- **Nepal verified rubella elimination on 18 August 2025.**

- Transmission of endemic rubella virus interrupted; CRS cases reduced significantly.


---

### 5. **Conclusion & Future Implications **

- Nepal’s success shows strong immunization + surveillance can eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases.

- However, **continued MR vaccination and surveillance are essential** to prevent re-introduction from imported cases.

- Next goal: **Measles elimination by 2026**.
